# Personal Portfolio Website

A clean, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to customize.

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The main page with all sections (hero, about, skills, projects, contact) |
| `styles.css` | All the styling — colors, layout, responsiveness |
| `script.js` | Interactive features — mobile menu, scroll animations, form handling |
| `CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md` | Step-by-step instructions for customizing everything |

## Features

- **Responsive design** — looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops
- **Smooth scroll navigation** — clicking a nav link scrolls to that section
- **Mobile hamburger menu** — the nav collapses into a menu on small screens
- **Scroll animations** — elements fade in as you scroll down
- **Contact form** — ready to connect to [Formspree](https://formspree.io) for free email delivery
- **Heavily commented code** — every section is explained so you can learn as you go

## How to View Locally

You don't need to install anything. Just open the file in your browser:

### Option 1: Double-click (simplest)
1. Find the `index.html` file in your file explorer
2. Double-click it — it will open in your default browser

### Option 2: Drag and drop
1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Drag the `index.html` file into the browser window

### Option 3: Using VS Code Live Server (recommended for development)
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (by Ritwick Dey)
3. Open this project folder in VS Code
4. Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**
5. The site will open in your browser and auto-refresh when you make changes

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)

GitHub Pages lets you host this website for free at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub**
   - If you cloned this repo, your code is already on GitHub
   - If not, create a new repository and push your files

2. **Go to your repository on GitHub** (github.com)

3. **Open Settings**
   - Click the **"Settings"** tab at the top of your repo

4. **Find "Pages" in the sidebar**
   - On the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**

5. **Set the source**
   - Under **"Branch"**, select **`main`** (or `master`)
   - Keep the folder as **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **"Save"**

6. **Wait a minute**, then visit:
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with this repository's name.

That's it — your portfolio is live on the internet!
